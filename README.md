# Handwritten-Character-Recognition-using-OCR-

- Developed a Machine Learning and Computer Vision program to extract text data from handwritten document images.
- Implemented Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to accurately identify characters from document images.  
- Achieved 98% accuracy in text data extraction

## Steps to run ##
Run index#1.py file in code folder 
and upload any handwritten image and you will find the text as an output
